Boxplot Interpretation,"A boxplot shows summary statistics like median, quartiles, and potential outliers.",A boxplot represents frequency counts using colored sectors.,"Boxplots use statistical summaries, not colored sectors—that’s more like a pie chart."
Sampling Distributions,The sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes more concentrated around the true mean as sample size increases.,"As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes more spread out.",The variability (standard error) decreases with increasing sample size.
Central Limit Theorem,The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as sample size grows.,The Central Limit Theorem states that all sample distributions are uniform regardless of sample size.,"CLT leads to normal, not uniform, distributions for large samples."
Data Wrangling Definition,Data wrangling involves transforming raw data into a tidy format suitable for analysis.,Data wrangling refers to visualizing data using bar and pie charts.,"Data wrangling is about transformation and cleaning, not visualization."
True Random Sampling,"In simple random sampling, every sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected.",Simple random sampling always gives more accurate results than stratified sampling.,"While simple, it’s not always the most accurate; stratified sampling can improve precision."
R Graph Types,"R can create many plot types such as histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, and bar charts.",R is limited to producing only pie charts and line graphs.,R offers a wide range of graphical tools beyond just pie and line charts.
ggplot Facets,"Facets in ggplot create multiple subplots based on values of a variable, useful for comparison.",Facets in ggplot are used to compute statistical summaries.,"Facets control visual layout, not statistical calculations."
Definition of Population and Sample,"A population is the entire group of interest, while a sample is a subset of that group used for analysis.",A sample contains more data than the population it is drawn from.,"By definition, a sample is a subset and cannot be larger than the population."
Statistical Inference,Statistical inference uses data from a sample to make conclusions about a population.,Statistical inference can directly measure parameters in a population.,We use sample data to estimate population parameters because population values are usually unknown.
Law of Large Numbers,"As the sample size increases, the sample mean converges to the population mean.",The law of large numbers ensures that individual values converge to the population mean.,"The law concerns the average of the sample, not individual values."
Central Limit Theorem,The distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as sample size increases.,The Central Limit Theorem says all variables become normally distributed with enough data.,"Only the distribution of the sample mean becomes normal, not the original variables."
dplyr Verbs,"The dplyr package uses verbs like select(), filter(), mutate(), arrange(), and summarize() for data wrangling.",dplyr is used for plotting data and generating graphs.,"dplyr is used for data manipulation, not for visualization."
Data Wrangling,Data wrangling involves transforming data into a tidy format suitable for analysis.,Data wrangling only refers to renaming variables for readability.,"It includes filtering, transforming, and reshaping—not just renaming."
Sampling Distribution Definition,A sampling distribution is the distribution of a sample statistic from repeated samples.,A sampling distribution is the distribution of all raw data in the sample.,"It's about the statistic (like the mean), not the raw data."
Boxplot Components,"A boxplot shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the data.",Boxplots show the relationship between two categorical variables.,"Boxplots summarize numerical distributions, not categorical relationships."
Histogram vs. Density Plot,"Histograms use bars to show frequency, while density plots show smoothed estimates.",Histograms and density plots are both used for categorical variables.,"They are both used for numerical (metric) variables, not categorical."
Tidy Data,Tidy data has one variable per column and one observation per row.,Tidy data organizes values by sorting them alphabetically.,"Tidiness refers to structure, not sorting."
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),"Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to summarize the main characteristics of data, often with visual methods.",EDA is used to confirm hypotheses using p-values and confidence intervals.,"EDA is for exploration, not hypothesis testing—that’s inference."
Simple Random Sampling,"In simple random sampling, every possible sample of the same size has equal probability of selection.","In simple random sampling, every individual has the same result.","Random sampling ensures equal chance of selection, not equal results."
Effect of Sample Size on Standard Error,Standard error decreases as the sample size increases.,Standard error increases with larger sample size.,Standard error is inversely related to the square root of the sample size.
Simpson’s Paradox,Simpson’s Paradox shows how trends observed in subgroups can reverse when the groups are combined.,Simpson’s Paradox explains why larger datasets are always more accurate.,"It demonstrates misleading aggregated results, not accuracy through size."
Regression Example by Galton,"Galton observed that children's heights tend to regress toward the population mean, a phenomenon now called regression.",Galton used regression to test hypotheses about kidney treatment.,"Galton studied hereditary height, not medical treatments."
Kepler’s Laws and Data Analysis,Kepler derived his laws of planetary motion by analyzing Brahe’s astronomical data.,Kepler formulated his laws by observing planets directly through telescopes.,"Kepler used data analysis, not direct observation."
Big Data Challenges,"Big data introduces challenges in computation, storage, and privacy.",Big data guarantees better conclusions due to more information.,Bigger data can contain more noise; it doesn't guarantee better insights.
Market Basket Analysis,Market basket analysis identifies items frequently bought together to optimize placement or promotions.,Market basket analysis is used to clean datasets and remove duplicates.,"It’s for discovering item associations, not data cleaning."
Data Cleaning,Data cleaning ensures data quality by identifying and correcting errors.,Data cleaning refers to deleting all rows with missing values regardless of context.,"Proper data cleaning can involve imputation or investigation, not blind deletion."
Prediction vs Classification,"Prediction deals with continuous outcomes, while classification assigns categories.",Prediction and classification are the same if the dataset is large enough.,They address different types of outputs: numeric vs categorical.
Prediction Example - Credit Rating,"In credit rating models, the response variable is often binary, such as loan paid back (1) or not (0).",Credit rating models usually use continuous response variables like apartment prices.,"Credit models classify individuals based on repayment likelihood, a binary outcome."
Visual Tools in EDA,Visual tools like histograms and boxplots help identify the spread and center of a dataset.,Histograms and boxplots are used to compare multiple nominal variables.,"They are primarily for numerical variables, not nominal ones."
Data Cleaning Importance,"Poor quality data can lead to misleading results, emphasizing the importance of data cleaning.",Statistical models are always robust to missing or incorrect data.,"Garbage in, garbage out: unreliable data leads to unreliable models."
Types of Statistical Tasks,"Common statistical tasks include estimation, hypothesis testing, and classification.",Statistical tasks are mainly about collecting data without any analysis.,Collection is just the beginning—analysis and interpretation are central to statistics.
Join Operations in Data Wrangling,Join operations combine data from different tables using a shared key.,Join operations are used to plot multiple datasets on the same graph.,"They merge tables, not visualize data."
Inference and Uncertainty,Inference methods quantify the uncertainty in estimates and predictions.,Inference eliminates all uncertainty by using exact population values.,"Inference deals with sample-based estimates, which are inherently uncertain."
Density Plot Characteristics,Density plots provide a smoothed view of the distribution of numerical data.,Density plots are used to display frequency counts of nominal variables.,"They visualize numerical variable distributions, not categorical frequencies."
